## Guide and information on the game

To navigate the ship the WASD keys can be used. Enemy ships will randomly spawn around the player and chase the player if nearby. To fire your cannons press space, once enemy ships have been hit they get destroyed.

To run the game, simply navigate to the bin folder and execute the file. Alternatively the project can be ran through Visual Studio.
